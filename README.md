## Problem Statement
Write a java program "FileSplitter" (command line based or GUI) that accepts a file name and number of lines(n) after which the file should be split. The file should be valid existing file and should have an extenstion ".txt". After splitting the multiple files should be generated, each of which should be of n lines consecutively. e.g. if file students.txt is of 23 lines and n=5 then the file students.txt should be split into 5 sub files namely students_1.txt, students_2.txt and so on, containing first five, next five lines and so on. Handle the appropriate exceptions. Once the file is split display the message of total number of files geneated after splitting. Can this program be implemented using multithreading? Give your views on it. The submission should be in single pdf containing code with comments, output, content of text file, content of first splitted sub file, your views of multi-threading feasibility.
